# SCSS foundations
This is a collection of helpful SCSS systems for starting new projects. It contains systems for:
* colors
* typography
* spacing

Update the SCSS maps to automatically generate utility classes and functions that return values for use inside of SCSS declarations.

## Getting started

## Colors
`background-color: color(brand);`

## Spacing
`margin-bottom:: spacing(xs);`

## Typography
```
.some-class {
  @include type(h4);
}
```
